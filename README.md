# ZaloDataTransfer

Just a small project for Zalo because of its FUCKING STUPID storage system. This tools will help you move Data from C Drive to another Drive without messing up the dumpy Zalo and gain more spaces for C Drive.

## Features

- Tranfer Zalo Data from C Drive to another Drive.
- Fix Zalo Shortcut after moving it (This only need for who moved the folder "Zalo").
- Restore Backup (If after moving but nothing goes right, use this to restore to original).
- Re-link Folders (use this feature when u have reinstalled Windows but still have Zalo data in other drive).

## Download

To get the tool, you just need to head to the [Release Page](https://github.com/BeSuaIT/ZaloDataTransfer/releases), or you can just click on the .bat file up there and click download raw file.

## Take notes

- Need to run in Administrator Rights.
- Need to close and end all Zalo processes in Task Manager (will make this feature in next update).
- For people using multiple accounts on Windows, you can select a specific user to perform the transfer (because Zalo is installed per user rather than system-wide, so the folder is located in the user's directory).
- This tool was inspired by [ZaloMove](https://github.com/NDWoodCompany/ZaloMove) by [NDWoodCompany](https://github.com/NDWoodCompany), but gains more features and be Open-source.
